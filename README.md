This repo is reworked so it only contains my scripts.

These Scripts are probably outdated because droidbox has evolved since then.

Download APIMonitor from the droidbox project and create images in the images/ folder like this:

    $ ls -al images/
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 reox reox   146673 Apr 16 17:01 ramdisk.img
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 reox reox 68842752 Apr 16 17:01 system.img
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 reox reox 43724700 Apr 16 17:01 userdata.img
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 reox reox  1586776 Apr 16 17:01 zImage*
